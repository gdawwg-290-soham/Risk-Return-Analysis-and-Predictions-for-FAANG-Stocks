---------------------------------Risk/Return-Analysis-&-Prediction-for-5-FAANG-Stocks------------------------------------------

1) Here I used pandas Dataframe to represent adjusted closing prices and compute moving averages, daily returns, and associated risk of 'FAANG' tech companies.
2) Created visual representations of comparative daily returns and single-stock analysis using Matplotlib, as well as more complex heatmaps and distribution plots using Seaborn.
3) Compared and plotted risk of investment between simple return analysis techniques and Monte-Carlo simulations.
